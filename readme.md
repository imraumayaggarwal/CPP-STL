# 🚀 CPP STL Basics: Pair, Vector, List, Deque, Stack

This repository explains important STL containers in C++.

---

## 🟢 Pair
`Pair.cpp`

A container that stores two heterogeneous values together. Useful for keeping related data items grouped as a single unit.

---

## 🟢 Vector
`Vector.cpp`

A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. Provides random access to elements and is efficient for adding elements at the end.

---

## 🟢 Deque
`Deque.cpp`

A double-ended queue that allows fast insertion and deletion at both the front and back. Supports random access like vectors.

---

## 🟢 Stack
`Stack.cpp`

A container adapter that implements the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can only be added or removed from the top.

---

## 🟢 Queue
`Queue.cpp`

A container adapter that implements the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

---

## 🟢 Priority Queue
`Priority_Queue.cpp`

A container adapter that provides constant-time access to the largest (or smallest) element. Internally implemented using a heap.

---

## 🟢 Set
`set.cpp`

An associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order. Provides fast lookup, insertion, and deletion (logarithmic time).

---

## 🟢 Multiset
`multiset.cpp`

Similar to `set`, but allows duplicate elements. Elements are still stored in sorted order and support logarithmic time operations.

---

## 🟢 Unordered Set
`unorderedset.cpp`

An associative container that stores unique elements in an unordered fashion using hashing. Provides average constant-time complexity for insert and lookup.

---

## 🟢 Singly Linked List
`SLL.cpp`

A linear linked list where each node points to the next; supports simple insertion and deletion.

---

## 🟢 Circular Singly Linked List
`CSLL.cpp`

A singly linked list where the last node connects back to the head, forming a circle.

---

## 🟢 List (Doubly Linked List)
`List_DLL.cpp`

A doubly linked list implementation. Allows efficient insertion and deletion anywhere in the sequence but does not provide random access.

---

## 🟢 Circular Doubly Linked List
`CDLL.cpp`

A doubly linked list where the last node links back to the head, enabling circular traversal in both directions.
