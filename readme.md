# 🚀 CPP STL Basics: Pair, Vector, List, Deque, Stack

This repository explains important STL containers in C++.

---

## 🟢 Pair
`Pair.cpp`

A container that stores two heterogeneous values together. Useful for keeping related data items grouped as a single unit.

---

## 🟢 Vector
`Vector.cpp`

A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. Provides random access to elements and is efficient for adding elements at the end.

---

## 🟢 List
`List.cpp`

A doubly linked list implementation. Allows efficient insertion and deletion anywhere in the sequence but does not provide random access.

---

## 🟢 Deque
`Deque.cpp`

A double-ended queue that allows fast insertion and deletion at both the front and back. Supports random access like vectors.

---

## 🟢 Stack
`Stack.cpp`

A container adapter that implements the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can only be added or removed from the top.
