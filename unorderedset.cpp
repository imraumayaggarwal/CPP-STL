What is unordered set?
- No duplicates
- No order
- Internally uses HashTable

-------------------
| 1. insert       |
| 2. find         |
| 3. erase        | {All same as previously Discussed}
| 4. count        |
| 5. size         | 
| 6. empty        |
| 7. swap         | 
| 8. clear        |
------------------- 

There is no upper_bound() and lower_bound() functions in Unordered_set.
Time Complexity is mostly better than Set, except for when there are hash collisions
